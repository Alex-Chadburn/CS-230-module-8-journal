# The Gaming Room - Web-Based Game Development
**Project Overview**
Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) was engaged by The Gaming Room to develop a web-based version of their existing Android game, Draw It or Lose It. This game, inspired by the 1980s television show Win, Lose or Draw, involves teams guessing images from a library of stock drawings. The new web-based game supports multiple platforms, enhancing accessibility and scalability.

## Client: The Gaming Room
**Software Requirements:**
Support for multiple teams, each with multiple players.
Unique game and team names.
Only one instance of the game in memory at any time.
Web-based application to support multiple platforms.

**Development Highlights**
Documentation Excellence: The documentation was particularly well-developed, ensuring clear communication of requirements and design constraints.
Design Document Process: Working through the design document was instrumental in developing the code, providing a structured approach to meet client needs.

**Areas for Improvement**
I could cut down on jargon, at the end of the day the company just wants a recommendation and why I believe it is the best fit. This could include simplifying and explaining the jargon terms they may be unfamiliar with. Specifically in System Architecture View, it almost assumes you know what these different kernals are and do. 

**User-Centric Design**
Interpreting and implementing the userâ€™s needs was crucial. Understanding the importance of user requirements ensured the software was both functional and user-friendly. Considering user needs is vital for creating intuitive and engaging applications.

**Design Approach**
The software design was approached with a focus on scalability, performance optimization, and security. Techniques such as using design patterns (Singleton, Iterator) and ensuring compatibility across platforms were key strategies. For future projects, I would continue to use these techniques and incorporate more feedback early in the design process.
